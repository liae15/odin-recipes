            <p>I first started making sushi during the pandemic, when there was too much free time and a lot of boredom around home-cooked food. Nowadays, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at making these rolls. This <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/how-to-make-sushi-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maki recipe</a> contains salmon, avocado, and cucumber and a very easy to make.</p>

            <h3>Note on Tools</h3>
            <p>This recipe requires a sushi mat and plastic wrap. A rice cooker is unneccessary, but highly recommended. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A small bowl of water, to put next to your sushi mat.</li>
            <li>100 batch of sushi rice</li>
            <li>5 sheets of nori, or seaweed "sheets"</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>2 avocados, peeled, pitted, and sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>10 ounces of sushi-grade raw fish (or smoked salmon), sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>Toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Spicy mayo</li>
            <li>Soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi, as sauces and toppings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep your ingredients (as listed above). Lay out the sushi mat on a flat surface and put and put a layer of plastic wrap over the sushi mat. This is to prevent the rice sticking to the mat.</li>
            <li>Put a sheet of nori on the sushi mat. Dip your fingers into the water to keep your hands less sticky.</li>
            <li>Press ~1 cup of cooked sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch uncovered border on the top and bottom of the nori.</li>
            <li>Lay out the salmon, avocado, and cucumber across the horizontal view of the sushi. Put them in thin lines to prevent crowding and evenly-distributed ingredients in the final maki rolls.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some sesame seeds over the nori.</li>
            <li>Roll up the sushi. Start the bottom edge of the mat and carefully roll the nori (moving the plastic wrap out of the way as you go). Dip your fingers into the water and use it to wet the outer 1-inch of nori to seal the roll together. Squeeze the roll tighter so the ingredients are more firmly packed.</li>
            <li>Tranfer the roll to a cutting board and make 8 equal cutes. Transfer these to your serving plate.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2-7 four more times, making a total of 5 rolls or 40 pieces of maki.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately (with your toppings), and enjoy! Feel free to drizzle spicy mayo or sprinkle more sesame seeds on your rolls.</li>
        </ol>
