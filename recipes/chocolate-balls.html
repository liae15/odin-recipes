            <p>Israeli chocolate “balls” are simple, cocoa, butter and tea biscuit truffles rolled in shredded coconut (or sprinkles, if you're in my family). They are nut and egg free and require no baking, making them an easy and safe choice for baking with kids and serving at parties.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g tea biscuits (or about 1.5 packs), crushed</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons granulated sugar (7 if you're being healthy)</li>
            <li>10 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>100g butter, melted</li>
            <li>Sprinkles, coconut flakes, or your topping of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a tray, set of plates, or other flat surface. Put a layer of tin foil or parchment paper on the bottom of each tray. (Alternatively, lay out mini-cupcake wrappers on a tray, making the final chocolate balls easier to serve).</li>
            <li>First, crush the biscuits into tiny pieces. I recommend sealing them in a ziplock bag, then using a cup to crush them within the bag. When you're done, pour the biscruit pieces into your bowl.</li>
            <li>Add your milk, sugar, cocoa, and vanilla extract into the bowl and mix them together.</li>
            <li>Melt your butter, then pour it into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Once your ingredients are fully mixed, wash your hands. This is to prevent the batter from sticking to your fingers *too much*.</li>
            <li>Set out a small bowl of your chocolate-ball topping.</li>
            <li>This is the fun part. Begin rolling your mixture into small, 1-2 bite-sized balls with your hands. Roll each chocolate ball in your topping until it is fully coated.</li>
            <li>Place each chocolate ball on the tray or in a cupcake wrapper.</li>
            <li>Once you finish rolling all your chocolate balls, I suggest putting them in the freezer for at least an hour. This keeps them more solid and easier to eat.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
